# mips-pipeline
Implementation of the MIPS pipeline processor using Verilog. 
Different functionalities are included in the implemented processor such as ADD, MOV, etc.
This project was carried out as part of the computer Architecture course offered at the University of Tehran under the supervision of [Prof. Safari](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~saeed/).
Also, it is important to note that pipelining is part of this project and different commands are efficiently executed using this feature.
